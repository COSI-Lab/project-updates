These are notes taken from the fourth COSI Webdev team meeting, which can be found
in presentation form [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rmMTaSn9_ny6_TUVKiYLUWGri-6hpgVlu08QKMYCBek/edit?usp=sharing) Benjamin discussed updates on the following projects:

This meeting, we discussed ideas on how to improve our [Mirror](http://mirror.clarkson.edu/) and [Dubsdot](https://dubsdot.cosi.clarkson.edu/) pages, and implementing a CS Outreach page overarching our current igniteCS homepage. Some of the things we talked about were:

* Mirror
	* Implementing a consistent style across site, text in middle of page.
* Dubsdot
	* Loading cosi-nav straight from Dubsdot.
	* Having descriptive icons within currently implemented link boxes.
* CS Outreach
	* Implementing a site for all CS outreach programs and projects.
	* Easy-to-follow link for project challenge mentees.
	* Would link to current igniteCS website, as well as any other future programs.
	* Hero image. [See official [Google igniteCS page](https://ignitecs.withgoogle.com/) for example.
	* Press release page.
	* Contact page.
	* Sponsor page.
	* Resources page
	* Tutorials, downloads, useful pages etc.
	* Pictures, make the site prettier.

Over the next week, Benjamin will design a CS Outreach site mockup. Weâ€™ll discuss changes to this design and new ideas next Sunday, and from there start implementing the website. Hope everyone had a great break!
