title: Dubsdot Jan 18 Update
author: Benjamin Lannon
---

Last week, we had a meeting on the ideas and foundations for DubsDot, the new
VM for hosting many web services and the name of the web development team in COSI.
The first project I had was to setup a landing page that has a portal to every
single website we maintain. It is now up and can be found at
[dubsdot.cslabs.clarkson.edu](https://dubsdot.cslabs.clarkson.edu). I expect to
go through many iterations of this site, but an initial version is complete for now.

Up next, I went through the VMs we want to transfer onto DubsDot. We are planning
on using Apache VirtualHosts to have them all be on the same VM with their usual
domains, and these services include:

- Print
- Fsuvius
- Talks

This week, we should can transfer at least one of these services and then get to
the rest next week if they aren't done this week.

If you are interested in joining DubsDot, come see me in the labs or contact me
at [lannonbr@clarkson.edu](mailto:lannonbr@clarskon.edu).
