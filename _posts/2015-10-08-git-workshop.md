Yesterday for this week's after-meeting slot, I hosted a workshop on how to use
Git. Git is a version control system that was developed by Linus Torvalds in the
mid 00s and has become one of the main version control systems. I went through
creating a simple repository, how to add files to the repo, commiting files, and
how to interact with a remote repository as well. Below is a table of basic
commands that can be used by typing into a terminal `git <command>` :

| Command | Description 				                 |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| init    | init a repository in the current directory   |
| status  | viewing current repo status 			     |
| add     | add a file into the index to be commited     |
| commit  | push a commit to the local repository        |
| push    | push local commits up to a remote repository |
| pull 	  | pull commits from a remote repository 		 |
| clone   | get a repository from some URL 				 |
| log  	  | get a log of previous commits 				 |

I also went over the Github Workflow including Issues and Pull Requests. With
Github (And subsequent sites like Gitlab and Bitbucket), these sites allow for
easy communication for projects and allow people to be able to contribute to
large pieces of software.

I had this talk in subsequent with Hacktoberfest: an event going on during
October. All you need to do is sign up with your Github username and email
and then you only have to push 4 pull requests to any open source project
and you will recieve a t-shirt at the beginning of November. For any other
information on Git, remote repository hosting, or Hacktoberfest, view any
