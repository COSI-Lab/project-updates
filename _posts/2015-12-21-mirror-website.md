title: Mirror Website Redesign Update
author: Benjamin Lannon
---

Since Mirror will be rebuilt in 2016, I have decided to start working on a new
website to go alongside it. Two things I wanted to do was make a clean design
and have the website be responsive. Many Open Source project websites aren't known
for having a 2010s website design, so I wanted to change this with the new site
for Mirror. Also, the web is heading towards a mobile-first future, so I am
creating the site to work on all sizes.

Below I have a preview of the desktop version of the new website as it is right
now:

as well as a mobile version:

Hardware is finally being shipped to the labs now, so once the new mirror is up,
I'll be pushing this new site up. While we wait though, progress of the site's
development can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/cosi-lab/Mirror2016).
