All three flask apps that were planned to be moved over to DubsDot (Fsuvius, Print
& Talks) have been properly transferred. Over the weekend I will be writing documentation
on how to add normal websites as well as flask apps onto Docs.

Up Next on Dubsdot is planning on redesigns for Mirror, Fsuvius, and Talks and many
projects will be upcoming.

Stay tuned,

Benjamin
