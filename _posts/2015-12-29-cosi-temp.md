Cosi-temp is a new Ruby gem I just created over the past few days. Instead of
copying an old Project Updates or Meeting Minutes post and clearing it out to use
for a new post, cosi-temp now will easily generate a template for each.

The only thing needed to do to install it is make sure you have Ruby installed and
then type in `gem install cosi-temp` and it is all set. You can go to the repository
for it on Github at [lannonbr/cosi-temp](https://github.com/lannonbr/cosi-temp)
for more documentation on its usage.

have a good rest of your break and see everyone next week!
