These are notes taken from the second COSI Webdev team meeting, which can be found
in presentation form [here.](https://docs.google.com/a/clarkson.edu/presentation/d/1xr2YZKhfbs9tSCFWub8742IKVDe6DwUdLnholS3qMHQ/edit?usp=sharing) Benjamin discussed updates on the following projects:

* COSI History
* Talks

Next, Benjamin described many helpful [resources](https://docs.google.com/a/clarkson.edu/document/d/1HGespF7hDGzRk_RzG5oSxxbBkBEXz33vYmzDmTewPN8/edit?usp=sharing) and how we could use them in our work.

Benjamin then went over the basics of Github workflow: how issues are brought up,
branched off, committed, and finally merged after discussion and review, showing
personal examples and examples from the pages of large companies.

As an example of Github workflow, Benjamin showed this [issue](https://github.com/blackbeam/rust-marc/issues/2) and [eventual pull.](https://github.com/blackbeam/rust-marc/pull/4)

Finally, Benjamin introduced the Jekyll platform, the platform used by COSI to
deploy project updates and meeting minutes.

Benjamin encouraged progress on [FreeCodeCamp's CSS, JS, and HTML tutorials](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) so come
next meeting we can be ready to do some work!

The Webdev [project page](https://github.com/orgs/COSI-Lab/projects/1) will be used as a location for helpful resources.
