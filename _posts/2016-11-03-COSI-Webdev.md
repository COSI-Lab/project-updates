title: "COSI Webdev Meeting 1"

This is some notes for the first COSI Webdev Meeting. I discussed all of the current
web projects including

* Dubsdot
* Docs
* Fsuvius
* Gitlab
* History
* CSLabs Homepage
* The-Internet
* Management
* Meeting Minutes
* Project Updates
* Print
* Talks
* Derpy Sayings
* Mirror Website
* Scheduler

Then, I went into that the web is now modern, clean, fast, and responsive due to huge
accomplishments over the past decade. Further on, COSI Webdev is going to be a group
that can learn from each other through inputting each of our unique skills to the group.
My proposed projects included 

* COSI History: A digital scrapbook / reference for COSI through the years.
* Talks: Needing a mobile friendly version
* COSI StyleGuide: A site to have as a base for all other branching projects.

Finally, I suggested that it would be good to meet once a week during the weekends
and I gave a couple resources including [Dubsdot](http://dubsdot.cslabs.clarkson.edu/),
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/), and [COSI-Lab](https://github.com/COSI-Lab) on GitHub.
Everyone who attended was sent an invite to the Github organization and can start contributing
to projects.

This upcoming weekend, I'll be holding a workshop on the GitHub workflow as well as pushing
updates to project-updates.
