title: cosi-nav web component

As of this morning, I have been updating the navigation bar at the top of the
majority of our web pages to use a web component. Now, whenever a new site needs
to be added, I just have to edit the template for the web component and copy
that file to each site rather having to add the addition to each page on the sites.

If you would like to see more, There is now a repo for the component at [COSI-Lab/cosi-nav](https://github.com/cosi-lab/cosi-nav).
