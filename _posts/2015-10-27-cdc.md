We discussed the issues discovered on Friday (sshing to localhost in psuedo-distributed 
mode), and the efforts to deal with them.  Benjamin Lannon, ITL build maintainer will be 
working with several CDC members to resolve this issue, hopefully before 
next meeting on Tuesday.  

We also discussed the possibiity of running our cluster with MATLAB, and concluded that it 
was potentially interesting, but unimportant at the current time.

See you all next week.
