On October 31st, we had the [7-Hour Roguelike](http://people.clarkson.edu/~richarcm/7hrl/Fall-2015/). It was pretty successful, with [quite a few participants](http://people.clarkson.edu/~richarcm/7hrl/Fall-2015/participants.html). A lot of people tried doing new, crazy things.

Here's the code for a few:

- Benjamin: [ExplodingHearts](https://github.com/lannonbr/ExplodingHearts)
- Killian and Corey: [sns](https://github.com/coddinkn/sns)
