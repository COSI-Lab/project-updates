This past sunday, we had a short meeting for COSI Webdev. Mainly, I went
through each site and discussed some improvements to them. Some examples
inlcuded:

* __Talks__: I've discussed in the past plenty of times, but Talks should
eventually have a mobile friendly version. I might just work on it over
december break.

* __Fsuvius__: Although Fsuvius already works on Mobile, it can be likely
touched up with a cleaner UI.

* __COSI History__: At the moment there isn't much style to the site, so we
can possibly plan at the beginning of next semester on some ideas for the
design of the website.

As well, if anyone has some comments on any of the particular sites, Visit
their repository on the COSI-Lab github page and post an issue. Try to add
a label on the issue to specify what it is (bug report, enhancement, etc.).

We will not be having a meeting this upcoming Sunday, Nov 27, but the
following Sunday we will. Have a good Thanksgiving everyone!
