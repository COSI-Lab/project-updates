The very first meeting of the Sol Language Dev/Design team (hereafter the Solarium) occurred today,
with the major topics including:

* **Meeting times:** Further meetings will still happen at 7PM on Mondays.
* **Orientation:** The architecture of the Sol language was discussed; we went over the categorization of the programming language, basic usage, and exactly how terrible the implementation is at the moment.
* **Ideas:** People were told to find inspiration for good programming language ideas and components.

Our next goal will be to look through the high-level structure of the project itself, leading into a discussion of extending and modifying the language as it exists.

A [Github organization](https://github.com/sol-lang/) for this now exists, and will be used to hold the source for future developments.
