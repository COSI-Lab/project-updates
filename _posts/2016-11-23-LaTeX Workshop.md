Last Thursday, I gave an intro workshop to the typsetting system known as LaTeX.
The slides for the workshop can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/112Oebdx_fx6IJc89ojDVWuyt4AkvxyrDT5CKBxAsFLc/edit?usp=sharing).

LaTeX is a system for preparing professional documents ranging from research
papers to resumes and presentation slides. It allows to easily write content
and then render a crisp representation of the markup as a pdf file. LaTeX is
also known for it's easy to use insertions of mathmatical symbols and formulas.

If you want to try LaTeX out, every machine in the labs has a GUI editor for
LaTeX called TeXmaker. As well, I highly suggest bookmarking the [LaTeX resource](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
on Wikibooks as it has a huge amount of documentation on everything you can do
with LaTeX.
